       Precision medicine (PM) refers to the nationwide initiative to
       incorporate individual differences into disease treatment and
       prevention. The initiative, supported by the National
       Institutes of Health (NIH), leverages the sophistication of big
       data analytics and cloud computing infrastructures toward
       increasing the efficacy of individualized care.

        This 'mini-project' will result in a manual detailing the setup 
        process of a Raspberry Pi cluster with two manager nodes and six 
        worker nodes. The cluster setup will be accomplished using Fabric
        which is a Python library that executes shell commands remotely 
        over SSH, and is thus a powerful tool to leverage in the creation 
        of a cluster. The cluster will run a Docker Swarm environment. The 
        manual culminates with the execution of a simple visual web server 
        that displays each node and the services running on each node.
