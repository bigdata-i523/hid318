  abstract  = {Genomics is a Big Data science and is going to get much bigger, very soon, but it is not known whether the needs of genomics will exceed other Big Data domains. Projecting to the year 2025, we compared genomics with three other major generators of Big Data: astronomy, YouTube, and Twitter. Our estimates show that genomics is a “four-headed beast”—it is either on par with or the most demanding of the domains analyzed here in terms of data acquisition, storage, distribution, and analysis. We discuss aspects of new technologies that will need to be developed to rise up and meet the computational chal- lenges that genomics poses for the near future. Now is the time for concerted, community- wide planning for the “genomical” challenges of the next decade.

  abstract  = {This article focuses on the potential impact of big data analysis to improve health, prevent and detect disease at an earlier stage, and personalize interventions. The role that big data analytics may have in interrogating the patient electronic health record toward improved clinical decision support is discussed. We examine developments in pharmacogenetics that have increased our appreciation of the reasons why patients respond differently to chemotherapy. We also assess the expansion of online health communications and the way in which this data may be capitalized on in order to detect public health threats and control or contain epidemics. Finally, we describe how a new generation of wearable and implantable body sensors may improve wellbeing, streamline management of chronic diseases, and improve the quality of surgical implants.},

We outline key challenges in precision medicine and present recent advances in data integration-based methods to uncover personalized infor- mation from big data produced by various omics studies. We survey recent integrative methods for disease subtyping, biomarkers discovery, and drug repurposing, and list the tools that are available to domain scientists. Given the ever-growing nature of these big data, we highlight key issues that big data integration methods will face.},

Methods: All physician-staffed ambulance missions conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2013 were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated for the type of missions and the need of a physician. Results: Out of 1 381 physician-staffed missions, 511 were cancelled or managed by telephone. Around 239 (17%) missions required active intervention, of which only one was considered directly life-saving.
Conclusions: Most of the missions neither required the interventional skills of a physician, nor could they be performed at distance. However, the added medical value of physicians was found to be in other prehospital situations, such as critical decision-making, staff education and research.},

For each phase, we introduce the general background, discuss the technical challenges, and review the latest advances. We finally examine the several representative applications of big data, including enterprise management, Internet of Things, online social networks, medial applications, collective intelligence, and smart grid. These discussions aim to provide a comprehensive overview and big-picture to readers of this exciting area. This survey is concluded with a discussion of open problems and future directions.},
