       Precision medicine (PM) refers to the nationwide initiative to
       incorporate individual differences into disease treatment and
       prevention. The initiative, supported by the National
       Institutes of Health (NIH), leverages the sophistication of big
       data analytics and cloud computing infrastructures toward
       increasing the efficacy of individualized care.

        Docker’s swarm mode allows for the use of their automated container 
        distribution technology across a cluster of computers on ashared subnet. 
        Each node of the swarm takes on the role of either a manger or a worker. 
        One may foresee that the initial setupand management of each node could be 
        a cumbersome experience,especially for swarms with many nodes. To mitigate 
        this problem, a Python package called Fabric can be used to execute shell 
        commands over ssh.

    title: Using Docker to Benchmark Virtual Machines
    abstract: >
        VirtualBox, a commercially-available hypervisor maintained byOracle, allows for 
        the creation of lightweight, Docker-ready virtualmachines running the Boot2Docker  
        operating system. This project articulates a formula for the creation of a VirtualBox 
        Boot2Docker virtual machine, and demonstrates how the performance of the virtual machine 
        can be benchmarked using popular utilities such as sysbench and stress-ng. The project will 
        culminate with a simple Python application for collecting, persisting, and visualizing 
        the benchmark data.
